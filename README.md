# AEMO-Data-Read
Reading instant price data from AEMO website, in Australia.

This is the beginning of a project to (hopefully) create a widget, probably running on an Arduino, to get the current price data from AEMO.  This is because I'm switching to an energy retailer who charges based on the current wholesale price, so it's valuable to know what the price is so we know whether to limit usage or whether we can go our hardest!

I'm leaving this up in a public repo so that people can have a look, and maybe use some of the info here.  But I definitely have the L-Plates on - reuse any of this code at your own risk!

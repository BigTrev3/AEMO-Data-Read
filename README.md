# AEMO-Data-Read
Reading instant price data from AEMO website

This is the beginning of a project to (hopefully) create a widget, probably running on an Arduino, to get the current price data from AEMO.  This is because I'm switching to an energy retailer who charges based on the current wholesale price, so it's valuable to know what the price is so we know whether to limit usage or whether we can go our hardest!
